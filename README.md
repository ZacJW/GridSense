# GridSense
Statistics server for micro-generator and grid-storage installations

GridSense collects battery management system and solar inverter data over the network to store in a local database. This data is accessible as useful visualisations and widgets via a webserver. See [GridSense-DataProbe](https://github.com/ZacJW/GridSense-DataProbe) for getting the data onto the network.
